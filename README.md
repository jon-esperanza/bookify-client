# Bookify Client
Github Repository for UNCC Senior Capstone Project.

## Description
This repository is the client or frontend service for the Bookify project. This is where the web application is designed and implemented.

## Project summary
This project will involve creating a web application with a microservice architecture. The web application is basically a Book Tracking Application called Bookify (for simplicity). The functionalities include keeping track of books read, currently being read, and future books to read. It is simple but will integrate lots of reading data collection on books, authors, and genres that the user has read. This data collection will be used to give the user a “portfolio” data page with all of their reading statistics and the ability to search through a catalog of books for something they might like. The overall goal of this application is to give the user a way to organize their reading lists, track their progress with relevant metrics, and explore new books.
